## 📜 Quest For Change: South African Youth Edition 📜

### 🔍 Project Vision
uBizo-Community Quest Application is a gamified platform where South African youth can contribute to social good while developing valuable skills. In a country with high youth unemployment, we're creating a space for young people to channel their energy into meaningful community projects, gain experience, and build their portfolios - all while having fun in a game-like environment.

### 🐉 The Dragons We're Slaying
- Youth unemployment
- Social isolation
- Lack of work experience
- Community problems that need solutions
- Skills gaps

### 🎯 How It Works
